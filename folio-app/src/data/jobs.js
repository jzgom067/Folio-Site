        title: "What is Hiveclass?",
        text: "Hiveclass is a digital physical education platform that reimagines youth sports. It solves a problem that largely came about during the pandemicâ€”keeping students active while quarantined at home. With the abundance of content available on the internet today, there was a surprising lack of engaging content when it came to sports. Hiveclass takes advantage of technology's evolution to offer high-quality physical education at your fingertips."

        title: "What have I contributed?",
        text: "Since joining the team in June 2023, I've been almost exclusively on the backend side of the platform. My role involves working with the database and generating analytics for the internal team. At one point, I tried out some full-stack development to make a tool that makes that information more accessible. After that, I dove head-first into learning how to use Looker for a more interactive and extensive platform for data visualization. Since then, I've been working to maintain those dashboards, adding more and more calculations for advanced analytics."

        title: "What have I learned?",
        text: "When starting this role, I very quickly learned about the fast pace of startups. At a moments notice I would be switching gears and working on something completely new, which usually involved learning a new system. For example, I had no experience working with databases and SQL coming into this role. Learning on the job can be a bit stressful, but I've come to appreciate the opportunity. The same goes for Looker, which leverages my SQL experience, but is unlike any system I've worked with before."

      {
        title: "What challenges have I faced?",
        text: "Given that Hiveclass is a startup with limited resources, I was often told to figure out how to do everything on my own. I was free to use anything I wanted to accomplish the goals, as long as it got done. It's a very stark departure from what I imagined would happen in a professional setting, but I've come to appreciate the freedom and trust that comes with it. I think that being able to teach yourself skills is invaluable, and the opportunity to do so in an environment like this is one of a kind."
      },
      {
        title: "What's next?",
        text: "At this point, I've had experience working with Hiveclass's backend and database for over a year. While I'm probably not allowed to talk about the company's plans for the future, I can say that I'm excited to see where my expertise could be used elsewhere. I've worked on a variety of projects, and I'm proud of all the things I've accomplished thus far."
