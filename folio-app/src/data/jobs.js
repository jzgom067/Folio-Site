        title: "What is Hiveclass?",
        text: "Hiveclass is a digital physical education platform that is \"reimagining youth sports\". It solves a problem that largely came about during the pandemicâ€”keeping students active while remote. With the abundance of content available on the internet, there is a surprising lack of high-quality and engaging content when it comes to sports. Hiveclass aims to fill that gap and more with a platform that provides videos and lessons across various sports and activities."

        title: "What have I contributed?",
        text: "Since joining the team in June 2023, I've been almost exclusively on the backend side of the platform. My role involves working with the database and generating reports for the internal team. I made a tool that makes that information accessible via a website, but I quickly dove head-first into learning how to use Looker for a more extensive and interactive data visualization platform. Since then, I've been working to maintain dashboards, adding more and more calculations for advanced analytics."

      {
        title: "What have I learned?",
        text: "After starting this role, I quickly learned about the fast pace of startups. At a moments notice I would be switching gears and working on something completely new, which usually involved learning some new system. Learning on the job can be stressful, but I've come to appreciate the opportunity, as I've gained many new skills that I wouldn't have otherwise."
      },
      {
        title: "What challenges have I faced?",
        text: "Given that Hiveclass is a startup with limited resources, I was often told to figure out how to do everything on my own. I was free to use anything I wanted to accomplish my tasks, as long as it got done. It's not exactly what I imagined for a corporate job, but I've come to appreciate the freedom and trust that comes with it. I think that being able to teach yourself skills is invaluable, and the opportunity to do so in an environment like this is one of a kind."
      },
      {
        title: "What's next?",
        text: "At this point, I've had experience working with Hiveclass's backend and database for over a year. While I'm probably not allowed to talk about the company's future plans, I'm excited to see where my expertise could be used elsewhere. I've worked on a variety of projects for the company, and I'm proud of the things I've done for them."
